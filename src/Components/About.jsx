            I am a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer with over 2 years of experience in 
            designing, developing, and deploying web applications. Having recently graduated in 2025 
            with a degree in Computer Science, I have honed my technical skills and deepened my 
            understanding of modern software development practices. My expertise spans across both 
            frontend and backend development, enabling me to create comprehensive and efficient 
            solutions that align with business and user needs. Throughout my academic and 
            professional journey, I have contributed to a diverse range of projects, including an 
            Electric Vehicle System (EVS) that facilitates real-time tracking, battery management, 
            and user interactions, as well as an App Store Platform that allows users to discover, 
            download, and review applications while ensuring optimized performance and scalability.

            tools like Redux, I specialize in building responsive and dynamic UIs using HTML5, CSS3, 
            SCSS, and Tailwind CSS. On the backend, I am skilled in developing robust APIs using 
            Node.js and Express.js, with experience in database management using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, 
            and MySQL. I am well-versed in implementing authentication mechanisms like JWT and OAuth 
            and deploying applications on cloud platforms such as AWS and Vercel. My strong 
            problem-solving abilities, passion for continuous learning, and effective communication 
            skills allow me to translate complex business requirements into scalable technical 
            solutions. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that challenge me and provide
